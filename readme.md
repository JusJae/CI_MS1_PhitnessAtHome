## User Experience (UX)

---
---

 A person who is interested in getting in shape at home, but does not know what type of workout they would like to do. They would come to this website to find a workout to do at home and be able to get in contact with a personal trainer to book in the next remote workout session.

## Project Goals

---

### First Time User Goals

When the user initially enters the site they are greeted with an clearly labelled navigation menu  to all pages. This is followed by a welcoming hero image with text overlay that includes the slogan that explains the name and objective if site.

There is then a call to action button to "Start…".  
At this point the user can click the call to action button or continue scrolling down, both options will take the user to information the exercises that they will be able to get information from the site.

The user will find three cards that each link to the exercise section it reflects.
This is designed to help the user have easy access to the exercise content.

The site has been designed to have styling and usage ease and this is represented through
The user has two options, click the call to action buttons or scroll down, both of which will lead to the same place, to learn more about the organisation.

The user has access to a call to action button at the bottom of the pages barring the home page, where it located below the hero image.
This helps the user move freely throughout the site and not feel restrained to just that page.

When a user complete the user form on the contact page they will be returned to the home page.

On the Contact Us Page, after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the user is brought to the top of the page where the navigation bar is.

At the bottom of the Contact Us page, the user is told underneath the form, that alternatively they can contact the organisation on social media which highlights the links to them.

## Design

### Typography

Exo | Lato | Oswald

The fonts that were used throughout the site are 'Exo', 'Lato' and 'Oswald'.  

Exo was used for heading and sub headings as it has a bold standout style that looks digital but welcoming to reflect the digital workout tool.
'Lato' was used for buttons and call to action and menu for its ease of readability.
Oswald was used for the body of text.

### Colour Scheme

#### Palette

![Colour scheme](./docs/palette.png)

I used a simple black and white base to the site with vibrant yellow  and blue accents to match the brand theme.
These colours contrast very well for users who may struggle colour differentiation.
The colours also allow for dark mode filters to easily changed the colours the user.

The exercise cards are colours based on their category, using red for 'Burn'exercises, yellow for navigation bar menu and buttons and the 'Build' exercises and blue for 'Stretch' exercises and active menu tab when dropdown selected.

## Wireframes

Wireframes were designed at the start of this project to map out the site but the site has slightly changed since it its original conception to simplify the layout and add different elements and remove unnecessary elements for current features such as a music player.

In addition to not having originally planned to have a custom 404 page but adding it in during the project.

## Testing

### Responsiveness

The 'Phitness at Home' website was tested through on the following browsers:

- Firefox
- Google Chrome
- Safari


The site was also tested using different size screens to check the responsiveness of the code. I looked at the site on the following screen sizes:

- Laptop
- Laptop touch
- iPhone SE/XR/12/12 Pro
- iPad Air/Mini
- Pixel 5
- Nest Hub/Max
- Galaxy S8+/S20

This allowed me to see if the code was responding to the media queries ut in and the different CSS styling.

### User Testing

---
I asked my peers to review the site when it was completed to give me their honest feedback, in order to make adjustments to the site based on real-time feedback.

#### User Feedback Example

>"Home Phitness is a really straight forward and clear to use.
I kind of struggle using websites as i have dyslexia sometimes find it quite difficult to read. Home Phitness  did it for me i was really intrigued at how clear everything was. I found that the about us page was very clear and straight to the point giving me the options to select what i’m interested in and sending it through.
My favourite part of the website was that you can find your own comfort of exercising at home this highlighted everything for me and i was more drawn in as finding the time to go gym is really long after a long day at work and having to travel.
I loved how  the “exercise” and  “build”  and “stretch” sections, demonstrated how to do the exercise  followed by pictures and small video clips of how to do it, also the fact it had minimal writing and just set out how many to do and for how long really encouraged me.
Overall fantastic website and look forward to seeing more workouts to add to my routine. I will definitely recommend to anyone who wants to start a journey in fitness at home."

## Validation

---
The website was tested through W3C validator for HTML and CSS, WAVE Web AIM Accessibility Tool.
I ran the site through the validation tools to check for errors whilst creating the project and to fix them within the code.
The site was found ot have no errors in either HTML or CSS when using the validation tools as well as no contrast issues as shown when using the checker.

## Bugs

Whilst developing this site I came across a few bugs/issues with the code written. I have listed the bugs and the fixes where possible.

- Exercise Card Sizing

	I was able to resolve the bug that was found in the exercise cards incorrectly resting when opened on different screen sizes. This was resolved through the use of Bootstrap.

- Exercise Card Video Sizing 

	The exercise video for V-Crunches I was not able to resize the video to fit the length of the card without it distorting the video aspect ratio. I was not able to fix this bug.

	The Push-ups video was another video that I was not able to get to stretch to be the same length as the other videos within the Burn category.
